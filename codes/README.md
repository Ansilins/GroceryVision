# Grocery Shop Automation with Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to automate the process of product identification and pricing in a grocery shop using computer vision techniques. By analyzing images of products, the system identifies the product and retrieves its price, thereby streamlining the checkout process.

## Features

- **Product Identification:** Utilizes computer vision algorithms to recognize products in images.
- **Price Retrieval:** Retrieves the price of identified products from a database or external source.
- **Automated Checkout:** Facilitates automated checkout by eliminating the need for manual scanning and input of product information.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for both customers and shop attendants.
